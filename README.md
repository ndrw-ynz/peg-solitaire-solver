# Peg Solitaire Solver
## Project Update
The project only functions normally without the solving component of the GUI application as it turns out that running a computationally expensive GUI and pairing it with a **brute-force backtracking algorithm** takes up a lot of resources. :upside_down_face:

The project will be completed on a **later** date. :hand_over_mouth:
